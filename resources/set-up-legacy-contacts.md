# How to set up legacy contacts

In the event that you die, disappear or are otherwise unable to access your online resources, most platforms allow you to set a **Legacy Contact**. Think of this as a person who will have permission to take over your account should the worst happen and either take action to pass control to others, or to post a message infoming people of the situation.

It's up to you who you choose for this - it might be a spouse or a partner, or a close friend, but the most important thing is that you **inform them that they are your legacy contact on that platform**, and provide them with information on what to do if they need to enact this role.

Here's how to set up a legacy contact on various tools that you might be using.

## Coding platforms
