# Contributing to resilience resources

These resources get better when more people share their experience. If you've been through a difficult transition - a maintainer departure, a founder stepping back, an unexpected crisis - your lessons matter.

## How to contribute

### Share your experience

The most valuable contributions come from real-world experience. If you've lived through what we're trying to help people prepare for, share what worked and what didn't.

**Good contributions:**
* Specific items missing from checklists
* Better ways to phrase questions in audits
* Real scenarios that would make good workshop exercises
* Templates or processes that actually worked in practice
* War stories that teach important lessons (anonymized if needed)

**Less useful contributions:**
* Theoretical best practices you haven't actually tried
* Generic advice copied from other sources
* Pedantic corrections that don't improve clarity

### Ways to contribute

**Add to existing resources**
Open a pull request with specific additions or improvements. Explain why based on your experience.

**Suggest new resources**
Open an issue describing what's missing and why it matters. Better yet, draft it and submit a PR.

**Share your story**
Use GitHub Discussions to share your transition story. What was your bus factor crisis? How did you handle it? What would you do differently?

**Test and provide feedback**
Use these resources with your own project. Tell us what worked and what didn't. Open issues with specific feedback.

## Style guidelines

Write for humans, not for perfection:

* Use plain language - if a 12-year-old can't understand it, simplify it
* Be specific and practical - 'Set up 1Password Teams account' not 'Consider password management solutions'
* Share real examples - anonymous is fine, but concrete beats abstract
* Write in second person - 'you' and 'your project' not 'one should consider'
* Keep it scannable - use lists, headings, and short paragraphs

## Review process

Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers and community members who have relevant experience. We're looking for:

* Does this reflect real-world experience?
* Is it practical and actionable?
* Does it make the resource more useful?

Expect constructive feedback. This is a collaborative process.

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Everyone here is trying to build more resilient projects. We're all learning from each other's hard-won experience.

Assume good faith. If something seems wrong, ask questions before criticising.

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion. We're building this together.
