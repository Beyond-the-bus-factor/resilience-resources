# Succession planning guide

Succession planning isn't just for when someone leaves. It's for building a project that can grow beyond any individual contributor, including you.

This guide helps you plan for three types of transitions:

1. **Planned departures** - Someone stepping back with notice and handoff time
2. **Unexpected absences** - Sudden illness, burnout, or life changes with little warning
3. **Gradual transitions** - Shifting from active leadership to advisory roles over time

## Why succession planning matters

Most open source projects fail not because the technology is bad, but because key people leave and nobody knows how to continue. Succession planning is how you prevent that.

Good succession planning means:
- Your project survives leadership changes
- Contributors can take breaks without guilt
- New leaders can step up with confidence
- The project isn't held hostage by any individual

## The three types of succession

### Technical succession

Transferring knowledge, access, and capability to maintain and develop the technology.

### Governance succession

Transferring decision-making authority and the responsibility for project direction.

### Community succession

Transferring relationships, trust, and the ability to nurture contributors.

Most succession planning focuses only on technical handoff. All three are essential.

## Planning for expected transitions

When someone plans to step back, you have time to do it properly. Use it.

### 90 days before departure

**Knowledge transfer**
- [ ] Document the context behind major decisions
- [ ] Create a 'knowledge map' of what this person knows
- [ ] Identify critical knowledge that lives only in their head
- [ ] Schedule time for them to brain-dump with successors

**Access transfer**
- [ ] Audit what access and credentials they hold
- [ ] Transfer admin rights and permissions to successors
- [ ] Ensure password manager access is shared
- [ ] Update account ownership for services and domains

**Relationship mapping**
- [ ] List key external relationships (sponsors, partners, collaborators)
- [ ] Introduce successors to important contacts
- [ ] Document the context and history of these relationships
- [ ] Plan how to announce the transition to external parties

**Governance clarity**
- [ ] Document what decisions this person currently makes
- [ ] Clarify who will make those decisions going forward
- [ ] Update governance documents with new structure
- [ ] Communicate changes to the community

### 60 days before departure

**Shadow period**
- [ ] Successors shadow the departing person on their regular tasks
- [ ] Departing person reviews how successors handle responsibilities
- [ ] Practice decision-making with the departing person as backup
- [ ] Test access and processes to ensure everything works

**Documentation sprint**
- [ ] Write down processes for recurring tasks
- [ ] Document the 'why' behind technical and governance decisions
- [ ] Create runbooks for common scenarios
- [ ] Record video walkthroughs of complex processes

**Community preparation**
- [ ] Draft announcement of the transition
- [ ] Prepare community for the change
- [ ] Introduce successors in community spaces
- [ ] Explain what will stay the same and what might change

### 30 days before departure

**Final handoff**
- [ ] Complete all outstanding tasks or hand them off explicitly
- [ ] Transfer any remaining access or credentials
- [ ] Final review of documentation with successors
- [ ] Ensure successors have everything they need

**Communication**
- [ ] Announce the transition to the community
- [ ] Thank the departing person publicly for their contributions
- [ ] Introduce successors and their new roles
- [ ] Clarify how community members should adapt to the change

**Ongoing relationship**
- [ ] Discuss what the departing person's future involvement will be
- [ ] Set boundaries about when/how to contact them with questions
- [ ] Create an advisory role if appropriate
- [ ] Plan for knowledge gaps that emerge after they leave

### After departure

**Check-in points**
- [ ] 1 week: How are successors coping? What's broken?
- [ ] 1 month: What knowledge gaps have emerged?
- [ ] 3 months: What processes need adjusting?
- [ ] 6 months: What did we learn for next time?

**Continuous improvement**
- [ ] Document what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Update succession plan based on lessons learnt
- [ ] Identify new bus factor vulnerabilities that emerged
- [ ] Start planning for the next transition (there's always a next one)

## Planning for unexpected transitions

When someone disappears suddenly - illness, burnout, personal crisis, death - you don't have time for a graceful handoff. You need emergency protocols.

### Immediate response (first 24 hours)

**Verify the situation**
- [ ] Confirm this is a real emergency, not just someone on holiday
- [ ] Contact designated emergency contacts if appropriate
- [ ] Decide who has authority to activate succession plans
- [ ] Determine if this is temporary or permanent

**Stabilise operations**
- [ ] Activate emergency access protocols (password manager, accounts)
- [ ] Ensure critical systems keep running (deployments, monitoring)
- [ ] Identify what absolutely must be handled immediately
- [ ] Assign emergency responsibilities to available people

**Internal communication**
- [ ] Inform core team/leadership of the situation
- [ ] Be honest about what you know and don't know
- [ ] Assign someone to coordinate the response
- [ ] Set up check-ins for the team

**External communication**
- [ ] Decide what to tell the community (balance transparency with privacy)
- [ ] Post a brief, factual announcement
- [ ] Set expectations about response times and project continuity
- [ ] Identify a single point of contact for questions

### First week

**Assessment**
- [ ] What critical knowledge or access did we lose?
- [ ] What tasks can't be completed without this person?
- [ ] Who can pick up which responsibilities?
- [ ] What can wait and what can't?

**Temporary assignments**
- [ ] Distribute immediate responsibilities among available people
- [ ] These don't have to be permanent - just cover the gap
- [ ] Document what you're doing as you figure it out
- [ ] Accept that things will be messy for a while

**Documentation recovery**
- [ ] Search emails, chat logs, issue trackers for context
- [ ] Reach out to people who worked closely with the departed person
- [ ] Reconstruct knowledge that wasn't written down
- [ ] Document what you're learning as you go

### First month

**Permanent structure**
- [ ] Decide on longer-term ownership of responsibilities
- [ ] Update governance documents to reflect new reality
- [ ] Communicate new structure to the community
- [ ] Acknowledge what you've lost while showing continuity

**Knowledge gaps**
- [ ] Identify what you still don't know how to do
- [ ] Prioritise learning based on urgency
- [ ] Decide what to rebuild vs abandon
- [ ] Accept that some context is permanently lost

**Emotional processing**
- [ ] Give the team space to grieve or process the loss
- [ ] Acknowledge the difficulty of the transition
- [ ] Celebrate the departed person's contributions
- [ ] Support people taking on unexpected new responsibilities

### Long-term recovery

**Rebuild resilience**
- [ ] Distribute the responsibilities that were concentrated in one person
- [ ] Document what you learned about your vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update emergency protocols based on this experience
- [ ] Ensure this doesn't happen again with the new structure

**Moving forward**
- [ ] At some point, the project needs to move beyond the crisis
- [ ] New leadership needs permission to make different decisions
- [ ] The community needs to adjust to new normal
- [ ] Document this experience to help the next project that faces it

## Gradual transition planning

The healthiest transitions happen gradually - someone shifts from active leadership to advisory over time.

### Phase 1: Preparation (6-12 months)

**Identify successors**
- [ ] Look for people who show interest and capability
- [ ] They don't have to be just like you - different strengths are valuable
- [ ] Discuss with potential successors whether they're interested
- [ ] Be honest about the responsibility and time commitment

**Start delegating**
- [ ] Hand off small, contained responsibilities first
- [ ] Let successors make real decisions, even if you'd decide differently
- [ ] Provide backup without micromanaging
- [ ] Gradually increase complexity and importance of delegated work

**Build public visibility**
- [ ] Have successors represent the project at events
- [ ] Let them write announcements and blog posts
- [ ] Introduce them in leadership contexts
- [ ] Build their reputation and authority in the community

### Phase 2: Transition (3-6 months)

**Shift decision-making**
- [ ] Stop being the first person consulted on decisions
- [ ] Redirect questions to successors
- [ ] Let them make mistakes and learn from them
- [ ] Support them publicly even when you disagree privately

**Change your role**
- [ ] Announce that you're transitioning to advisory/emeritus role
- [ ] Be explicit about what you will and won't be doing
- [ ] Set boundaries on your availability
- [ ] Give successors permission to ignore your advice

**Knowledge transfer**
- [ ] Focus on context and 'why' not just 'how'
- [ ] Share the messy history, not just the official version
- [ ] Introduce successors to your external relationships
- [ ] Document things you think everyone knows but probably don't

### Phase 3: Advisory (ongoing)

**Be available, not involved**
- [ ] Respond when asked, don't volunteer opinions
- [ ] Provide context and history when requested
- [ ] Support successors' decisions publicly
- [ ] Resist the urge to take back control

**Let them lead**
- [ ] The project will change without you - that's healthy
- [ ] New leaders need freedom to make different choices
- [ ] Your way isn't the only right way
- [ ] Trust that you chose good successors

**Know when to leave entirely**
- [ ] At some point, your presence may hold back the project
- [ ] New leaders need space to establish their own authority
- [ ] It's okay to step away completely
- [ ] Your legacy is a healthy project that survives without you

## Common succession planning mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting until someone announces they're leaving

Succession planning should happen when things are stable, not during a crisis.

**Better approach:** Build succession into your normal operations. Rotate responsibilities. Cross-train continuously.

### Mistake 2: Only planning for technical handoff

The hardest parts of succession are governance and community, not technical.

**Better approach:** Plan explicitly for transferring decision-making authority and relationships.

### Mistake 3: Assuming documentation is enough

Documentation helps, but it can't replace shadowing, practice, and relationship building.

**Better approach:** Combine documentation with hands-on transfer of knowledge and relationships.

### Mistake 4: Not letting go

The outgoing person hovers, second-guesses, and undermines the new leadership.

**Better approach:** Set clear boundaries. Step back fully. Let successors make different choices.

### Mistake 5: Picking someone exactly like the current leader

Diversity in leadership styles and perspectives makes projects more resilient.

**Better approach:** Look for people with complementary strengths, not identical ones.

### Mistake 6: Making it a surprise

Sudden announcement of new leadership creates uncertainty and resistance.

**Better approach:** Signal transitions early. Introduce new leaders gradually. Give the community time to adjust.

### Mistake 7: Treating it as a one-time event

Succession planning is continuous. There's always a next transition.

**Better approach:** Build succession into project culture. Make it normal, not exceptional.

## Questions for reflection

- When was the last time you talked about succession planning with your team?
- Who would take over your responsibilities if you stepped back tomorrow?
- What knowledge lives only in your head that should be shared?
- Are you holding on to control that should be distributed?
- What would make it easier for you to step back when the time comes?

## Using this guide

Start small:
1. Pick one area where you're the single point of failure
2. Identify one person who could take it over
3. Spend one month deliberately transferring that responsibility
4. Document what worked and what was hard
5. Repeat with the next area

Succession planning is about building something that can grow beyond you. Let it.

*Good succession planning means the project barely notices when you're gone. That's the goal.*
